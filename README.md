# ZeDMD_ESP32
Arduino code for the ZeDMD ESP32.

The code is now half my credit and half the credit of Markus Kalkbrenner as he made so many outstanding improvements in the serial communication code that the display on the device is way more smooth and stable than before. Thanks Markus.

This is the specific repo for the Arduino code of the ESP32 for the ZeDMD.

The PC code has been integrated in the Freezy dmd-extensions https://github.com/freezy/dmd-extensions inside the LibDmd/Output/ZeDMD directory.

The full tuto on installation is available in English here https://www.pincabpassion.net/t14796-tuto-zedmd-installation-english and in French here https://www.pincabpassion.net/t14798-tuto-installation-du-zedmd

Any other language translation is welcome and will be added to the tuto if sent.

Thanks, David aka "Zed"

1/ Everything from my cheap real DMD "ZeDMD" to my "Serum" (aka "cRom") file format and its editor "ColorizingDMD" are linked to freezy DMD-extensions, they are open-source and subjects to the same license, GPLv2.
I DON'T EARN a thing from them (except perhaps some kind feedbacks and a place in the vpin world), not even a single Euro!
My ZeDMD may be sold by any reseller who wants to but I don't want to get anything AT ALL from that!

2/ It is important to me that all the things I code or create remain in the open-source DIY side, so any concept from my code (like colour rotations or sprites) CAN NOT be used in encrypted/protected /closed-source code/file format!
