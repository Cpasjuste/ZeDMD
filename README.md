# ZeDMD
ESP32 firmware code for ZeDMD.

The code is now half the credit of David Lafarge (aka "Zed") and half the credit of Markus Kalkbrenner as he made so many outstanding improvements in the serial communication code that the display on the device is way more smooth and stable than before. Thanks Markus.

This is the specific repo for the Arduino code of the ESP32 for the ZeDMD.

For VPX users, the PC code has been integrated in the Freezy dmd-extensions https://github.com/freezy/dmd-extensions inside the LibDmd/Output/ZeDMD directory.

The full tuto on installation is available in English here https://www.pincabpassion.net/t14796-tuto-zedmd-installation-english and in French here https://www.pincabpassion.net/t14798-tuto-installation-du-zedmd

Any other language translation is welcome and will be added to the tuto if sent.

Thanks, Zed and Markus Kalkbrenner

1/ Everything from my cheap real DMD "ZeDMD" to my "Serum" (aka "cRom") file format and its editor "ColorizingDMD" is open-source and subject to the **GPLv2+** licence with only a restriction (see 3/).
WE DON'T EARN a thing from them (except perhaps some kind feedbacks and a place in the vpin world), not even a single Euro!
Our ZeDMD may be sold by any reseller who wants to (see 3/) but we don't want to get any money AT ALL from that!

2/ It is important to us that all the things we coded or created **remain in the open-source DIY side**, so any concept from our code (like colour rotations or sprites) **CAN NOT be used in encrypted/protected/closed-source code/file format** but freely for any open-source project as long as you credit us!

3/ For manufacturers or resellers of any shield, frame or whatever linked to the ZeDMD, our only request is that the device is **ostensibly called as "ZeDMD something"**. "ZeDMD" should be what you see first when you look at the device. Also, **a link to this Github** should be provided with the device.
